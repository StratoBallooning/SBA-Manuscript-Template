abstract = {High Altitude balloon flights have become common place as a tool for students, researchers and hobbyists. As high altitude balloons have become an inexpensive way for groups and individuals to reach near space conditions, a need has come up to implement better support systems to accommodate a wide variety of experiments. One of those systems is with the electrical system that is used to conduct tracking, data logging, data processing and control of the balloon system. This paper covers our proposed solution to an electrical system that is both robust and flexible to cover a number of experiments in high altitude ballooning. This electrical system uses a central board concept that uses expansion ports to expand functionality from the base functions. This is then coupled with a CAN bus to enable communication between various subsystems.},

abstract = {A new organization called the Stratospheric Ballooning Association, a non-profit organization, has been formed with the mission to make stratospheric ballooning accessible to everyone. This organization will accomplish this mission by promoting, educating and informing educational agencies and the general public in the areas of high altitude or stratospheric activities such as high altitude ballooning. The organization will also serve as a clearinghouse that will include safe operating procedures and best practices to be applied to high altitude ballooning. The purpose of this paper is to inform the public what the Stratospheric Ballooning Association is about and what the mission and goals of the organization are. In addition, this paper will discuss some opportunities that the Stratospheric Ballooning Association has planned to meet this goal as well as some of the data they have collected so far on the topics of ballooning practices and systems used.},

abstract = {A low cost method for introducing students to science and engineering is in the use of high altitude balloons. These balloons are capable of reaching near space altitudes and in many cases above 30 km above sea level. The use of high altitude balloons introduce students to science through a variety of experiments that can be carried out on these missions. Engineering is taught through the design, build and fly concept where students design critical components of the system, build them and then test the concept through flights. Students also learn the operations side of successfully launching, tracking and recovering a high altitude balloon. Because the flight costs of high altitude balloons are low, usually between {\$}400-{\$}600 USD, multiple flights can be carried out throughout a school year. This low cost allows us to give students access to near space conditions at a fraction of the cost for a normal space flight such as a cubesat mission. ?
