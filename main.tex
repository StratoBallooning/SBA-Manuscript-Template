\noindent This AHAC journal template is provided to help you write your work that meets the Stratospheric Ballooning Associations standards for conference proceedings and journal submissions.

\section*{Guide to using this template}

This template is provided so that authors have a template to use for all papers submitted. 

\subsection*{Author Information}

\subsection*{Submitting Papers}
All papers must submit to the site hosted by the Iowa State University Digital Press.  This can be found at \href{https://www.iastatedigitalpress.com/ahac/}{https://https://www.iastatedigitalpress.com/ahac/}.

\subsection*{Format}

This template informs authors on how we expect the papers to be formatted.  Authors may use this template and replace the text in this template. All manuscripts must be formatted using the following specifications:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item 12-point Time New Roman font, one column
    \item 1-inch margin on all sides
    \item Full justification
    \item Single spacing
    \item Must not exceed 15 pages, including tables and images
    \item References must follow a numbered format for references; references will not count towards the page limit
    \item All Figures must be captioned and referenced. Figures should be in line with the text at the top of the closest page.
    \item Appendices are not permitted or allowed; however, we do allow for supplemental files, images, and other material can be uploaded to Janeway for inclusion
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{References}

References need to use a numbered system like the IEEE system. Any example of references that can be cited \cite{Nelson2009} is shown here \cite{Nelson2013}, and you can see an example \cite{Nelson2014} of what the references look like in the references section below.
